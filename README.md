Send ping statistics for multiple hosts to Graphite

Description
-----------

This Python program takes a list of hostnames to collect ping statistics for.
It uses the 'fping' program to do the real work, and send the results to
Graphite. By default, it detaches itself from the console and continues to run
in the background.

Until stopped, the program starts an 'fping' for all the given targets and sends
30 ICMP ping packets. The results (min, max, average and mean ping round-trip
times, as well as packet loss percentage) are sent to a Graphite server, which
by default should be running on localhost:2003. It then sleeps until the next
minute on the system clock before it starts another 'fping'. This way, you get
one measurement per minute. This is not configurable at this time.

By default, it uses 'ping' as a prefix for the metric name in Graphite,
followed by the hostname, with dots replaced by underscores. So for a host
named 'host.domain.tld', you would get the following metrics in Graphite, all
of which are gauges:

* ping.host_domain_tld.avgrtt
* ping.host_domain_tld.minrtt
* ping.host_domain_tld.medianrtt
* ping.host_domain_tld.maxrtt
* ping.host_domain_tld.packetloss

Requirements
------------

* [fping](http://www.fping.org/) ([Debian](http://packages.debian.org/wheezy/fping))
* [python-daemon](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-daemon/) ([Debian](http://packages.debian.org/wheezy/python-daemon))
* A [Graphite](http://graphite.wikidot.com/) server

The program uses regular expressions to get useful numbers from the fping ouput, so
it depends on specific formatting of the output. The following fping programs are
known to be compatible:

* version 3.4 on RHEL 6.4
* version 3.2 on Debian Wheezy

The output should look like this (for 2 hosts, 3 packets per host):

```
www.github.io  : [0], 84 bytes, 4.26 ms (4.26 avg, 0% loss)
www.google.com : [0], 84 bytes, 8.35 ms (8.35 avg, 0% loss)
www.github.io  : [1], 84 bytes, 3.25 ms (3.75 avg, 0% loss)
www.google.com : [1], 84 bytes, 7.84 ms (8.09 avg, 0% loss)
www.github.io  : [2], 84 bytes, 3.32 ms (3.61 avg, 0% loss)
www.google.com : [2], 84 bytes, 7.86 ms (8.01 avg, 0% loss)

www.github.io  : xmt/rcv/%loss = 3/3/0%, min/avg/max = 3.25/3.61/4.26
www.google.com : xmt/rcv/%loss = 3/3/0%, min/avg/max = 7.84/8.01/8.35
```

Configuration
-------------

Set up a [Carbon/Whisper retention schema](http://graphite.readthedocs.org/en/latest/config-carbon.html)
for the ping statistics, keeping one sample per minute for some time, and
optionally some aggregations:

```
[ping]
pattern = ^ping\.
retentions = 1m:1d,5m:31d,60m:366d
```

At the top of the script, there are some configurable items. They can be modified by changing the script or
setting the corresponding environment variables:

```
# number of ping packets to send
packets = os.getenv("PACKETS", 30)

# Graphite
g_gost = os.getenv('GRAPHITE_HOST', 'localhost')
g_port = os.getenv('GRAPHITE_PORT', 2003)
g_prefix = os.getenv('GRAPHITE_PREFIX', 'ping')

# System
fping = os.getenv('FPING_PATH', '/usr/sbin/fping')
logfile = os.getenv('LOGFILE', '/tmp/ping-graphite.log')

# Daemonize -- use empty string to set to False
daemonize = bool(os.getenv('DAEMONIZE', True))
```
